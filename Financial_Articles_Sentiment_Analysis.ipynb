            "Summary: Nvidia (NVDA) had a little bit of everything for investors at its annual GTC event on Tuesday afternoon. For one, there was great theater such as CEO Jensen Huang donning his trademark black leather jacket while giving out t-shirts from a t-shirt blaster. There were also a lot of large numbers tossed around, especially a prediction of the AI infrastructure buildout reaching $1 trillion by 2028. The company even took the wraps off a host of more powerful chips to hit the market in the next few years in Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. Yet, Nvidia’s stock declined 3% by the close of trading despite what was a reaffirmation of the Nvidia growth story. So what gives here with the world’s most important stock? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson. Jackson shares his latest thinking on Nvidia and whether the bull run is poised to return…and when. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.
